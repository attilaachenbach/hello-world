Hello World Tutorial

After having a GitHub account for more than a decade, I am finally going through the Hello World tutorial to properly understand and learn how to actually use it. Cheers!

Update 2025-08-12 (6 years later): I am repeating the tutorial to learn how to work with GitHub, so that I can use it for building a dementia companion app for my mom.
